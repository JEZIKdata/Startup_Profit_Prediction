# Startup Profit Prediction

In this notebook, we're using the dataset of 50 startups to build a model to predict profits of the startup companies. 

## What Is a Startup? 

A startup company is a newly formed business with particular momentum behind it based on perceived demand for its product or service. The intention of a startup is to grow rapidly as a result of offering something that addresses a particular market gap.

As we can see that itâ€™s hard to manage and analyze the investments to startups and to make a profit out of them.
We need a way by which we can analyze our expenditure on the startups and then know a profit out of them!

## Building the model

We're going to build a machine learning model that will predict a profit based on how much the startup is spending in various areas of business.

## Features of the dataset

1. R&D spending: spending on Research and development
2. Administration spending: spending on the Admin panel
3. Marketing spending: spending on marketing strategies
4. State: to which state that particular startup belongs
5. Profit: how much profit that particular startup is making
